          <p>Hello! my name is Gibson Green and I am going into my junior (class of 2021) at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am a Software Engineering Major with a minor in Mathematics. I am a Stellar <br> 
            Research Assistant for Dr. Derek Buzasi at FGCU. Currently, I am researching Stellar bodies recorded in the  <em>2003 GALEX NASA</em> Campaign. I am using the gPhoton Software. I am in the <br>
            Honors College. I have held the position as an Honors College Mentor for the University. I mentored 5 new members of FGCU's Honors College, and helped them acclimate to the University and <br>
            bring them to speed on the expectations of the Honors College. Finally, I am a brother in the Florida Xi Chapter of the Phi Delta Theta Florida Xi chapter at FGCU. <br><br>
            In the world of Software Engineering, I have began my initial steps in my long future as an Engineer. I find myself extremely intrigued and interested and look forward to my education! <br><br>
            In my free time I love watching TedTalks about anything having to do with Futurism, I play Intramural Basketball and follow anything that has to do with basketball, I love playing video <br>
            games that include Fortnite, NBA 2k19, The Elder Scrolls series, etc.

                 star sources provided by Dr. Buzasi and develop light curves for the targets. For the Stellar Research team, I have also begun redesigning

                   I represented the school and the Honors College in helping develop and framiliarize incoming freshman Honors College

                     my teammate and I discovered one candidate exoplanet, one rotating star, and two binary stars. To conclude the course, I represented my class,
                      as Dr. Buzasi and I travel to Denver for the 232nd American Astronomical Society Conference. We presented our classes discoveries</a>

    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This website should display my knowledge of how to write, edit and learn these low-level languages. Images should display properly, the video should be easy to use, tabs and overall layout is simple to use and looks nice.
    Here are some of the examples of topics I learned over the course of the semester:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>embedding videos, images and files into HTML</li>
    <li>Using Javascript to have tabs and divide different sections for the website</li>
    <li>Adding stlying to the website using CSS and creating boxed text</li>
