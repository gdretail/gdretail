    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> Hello, my name is Gibson Green and I am currently a sophmore attending Florida Gulf Coast University. 
      I am currently on schedule to graduate by the year 2021. I am a Software Engineering Major, and on my free
      time, I am a research assistant on campus for Dr. Derek Buzasi. Currently, I am research stellar bodies in 
      the realms of Astrophysics using data collected from the 2003 GALEX NASA mission. I am alsoan Honors College
      Mentor, in which I am mentor 5 new members of FGCU's Honors College and get them acclimated to the Honors 
      Community as well as to the University. Finally, I am brother in the Florida Xi Chapter of the Phi Delta Theta
      fraternity at FGCU. </p>
     <p> Currently, in the world of Computer Science, I am just getting started along my path. Being a sophmore, I 
       recentely switch my Academic major from Bioengineering Pre-Med with a minor in Computer Science to switching
       comletely over to Software Engineering.This being said, I cannot wait to begin this journey of my life and 
       walk down this new path that I find myself extremely intrigued and interested in! 
     <p> In my free time I love watching TedTalks about anything futurism, I play intramural basketball and follow
       anything that has to do with basketball, I love playing video games that include Fortnite, NBA 2k19, The
       Elder Scrolls series, etc.
