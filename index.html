    <p>Hello, my name is Gibson Green and I am currently a sophomore attending Florida Gulf Coast University. 
      I am on schedule to graduate by the year 2021. I am a Software Engineering Major, and, on my free
      time, I am a Research Assistant on campus for Dr. Derek Buzasi. Currently, I am researching stellar bodies in 
      the realms of AstroPhysics using data collected from the <em>2003 GALEX NASA</em> mission. I am also an Honors College
      Mentor at FGCU. In summary, I mentor 5 new members of FGCU's Honors College, and get them acclimated to the Honors 
      Community, as well as to the University. Finally, I am a brother in the Florida Xi Chapter of the Phi Delta Theta
      fraternity at FGCU. <br> <br>
      Currently, in the world of Computer Science, I am just getting started along my path. Being a sophomore, I 
      recently switch my Academic Major from Bioengineering (Pre-Med) with a minor in Computer Science, to switching
      completely over to Software Engineering. This being said, I cannot wait to begin this journey of my life and 
      go down this new path. I find myself extremely intrigued and interested and look forward to my education!  <br> <br>
      In my free time I love watching TedTalks about anything having to do with Futurism, I play Intramural Basketball and follow
      anything that has to do with basketball, I love playing video games that include Fortnite, NBA 2k19, The
      Elder Scrolls series, etc.

  <p><strong>Website Accessibility & Usability</strong></p>
  <p>Here in Gibson Green's Portfolio Website, the goal was display was knowledge of the following Computer Languages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This website should display my knowledge of how to write, edit and learn these low-level languages. Images should display properly, the video should be easy to use, tabs and overall layout is simple to use and looks nice.
    Here are some of the examples of topics I learned over the course of the semester:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>embedding videos, images and files into HTML</li>
    <li>Using Javascript to have tabs and divide different sections for the website</li>
    <li>Adding stlying to the website using CSS and creating boxed text</li>
  </ul>
    <p> Here is a pdf displayed in HTML of my Field Report Assignment in my Introduction to Computer Science Course:</p>
