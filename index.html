      <p> <strong>Educational Experience</strong></p>
    <p> I graduated from Lake Forest High School back in 2017, in Lake Forest Illinois. Currently, I am a sophomore
    at Florida Gulf Coast University (Class of 2021). I have presented at The 232rd American Astronimcal Society, where 
    I presented Exoplanet Light Curve findings.</p>

      <p> <strong>About Me</strong></p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Gibson Green and I am currently a sophomore attending Florida Gulf Coast University. 
      I am on schedule to graduate by the year 2021. I am a Software Engineering Major, and, on my free
      time, I am a Research Assistant on campus for Dr. Derek Buzasi. Currently, I am researching stellar bodies in 
      the realms of AstroPhysics using data collected from the <em>2003 GALEX NASA</em> mission. I am also an Honors College
      Mentor at FGCU. In summary, I mentor 5 new members of FGCU's Honors College, and get them acclimated to the Honors 
      Community, as well as to the University. Finally, I am a brother in the Florida Xi Chapter of the Phi Delta Theta
      fraternity at FGCU. <br> <br>
      Currently, in the world of Computer Science, I am just getting started along my path. Being a sophomore, I 
      recently switch my Academic Major from Bioengineering (Pre-Med) with a minor in Computer Science, to switching
      completely over to Software Engineering. This being said, I cannot wait to begin this journey of my life and 
      go down this new path. I find myself extremely intrigued and interested and look forward to my education!  <br> <br>
      In my free time I love watching TedTalks about anything having to do with Futurism, I play Intramural Basketball and follow
      anything that has to do with basketball, I love playing video games that include Fortnite, NBA 2k19, The
      Elder Scrolls series, etc.
